feat: complete design system integration from DESIGN_PLAN.md

- Integrate color system (zinc-950/900/800, indigo-500, rose-500) into Tailwind v4 @theme
- Configure typography with Inter font priority and JetBrains Mono for monospace
- Add animation timing variables (duration-snap: 150ms, duration-standard: 200ms, ease-sharp)
- Fix Google Fonts @import CSS parsing error by using next/font instead
- Configure ClerkProvider routing to prevent auto modal display
- Update TODO.md to mark design system tasks as completed

Changes:
- app/globals.css: Add custom colors and animation timing to @theme inline block
- app/layout.tsx: Use next/font for Inter and JetBrains Mono fonts
- app/sign-in: Configure Clerk SignIn appearance
- middleware.ts: Ensure public routes are accessible without auto modal
